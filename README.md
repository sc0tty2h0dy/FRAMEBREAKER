# FRAMEBREAKER

**Rebuild the system. Rewire reality. Break the frame.**

FRAMEBREAKER is a grid-based, system-building simulation game that fuses automation, glitch pressure, and visual satisfaction into one hyper-addictive experience.

Designed from scratch for a mature audience. Inspired by the mechanical depth of Factorioâ€”but made to run on the human urge to create, optimize, and outsmart chaos.

## CORE LOOP

1. **Build** modular circuits and flows using nodes, processors, and amplifiers.
2. **Automate** recursive systems to generate energy, logic, and control signals.
3. **Adapt** as system corruption creeps in and introduces unpredictable variables.
4. **Upgrade** your simulation, unlock new tech trees, and push against entropy.
5. **Break** the frame and restart reality in New Game+ modes with new rules.
